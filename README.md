# Job Application Platform

## Overview
Originally developed as a monolithic application, this project is currently undergoing restructuring into a microservices architecture. The migration process involves separating the application's functionalities into individual microservices, each encapsulating a specific business capability. This transition is being conducted in a separate repository to ensure a focused and organized approach to the migration process.

## Features
- **Monolithic Application:** Initially structured as a single application encompassing all functionalities.
- **Microservices Migration:** Transitioning towards a microservices architecture by separating functionalities into individual services.
- **Single App Container:** Initially, all services are contained within a single application container.
- **Docker Integration:** Containerize application components for easy deployment.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Store application data in a PostgreSQL database for reliability and scalability.
