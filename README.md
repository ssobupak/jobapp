# Job Application Platform

## Overview
Originally developed as a monolithic application, this project is currently undergoing restructuring into a microservices architecture. The migration process involves separating the application's functionalities into individual microservices, each encapsulating a specific business capability. This transition is being conducted in a separate repository to ensure a focused and organized approach to the migration process.

## Features
- **Monolithic Application:** Initially structured as a single application encompassing all functionalities.
- **Microservices Migration:** Transitioning towards a microservices architecture by separating functionalities into individual services.
- **Single App Container:** Initially, all services are contained within a single application container.
- **Docker Integration:** Leveraging Docker for containerization of the monolithic application, paving the way for modular deployment.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Continuing to utilize PostgreSQL as the database backend, adapting it to suit the requirements of microservices architecture.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot:** Utilizing Spring Boot for building microservices and facilitating the migration process.
- **Docker:** Containerization platform facilitating the packaging and distribution of microservices.
- **PostgreSQL:** Continuously utilized as the database backend, now adapted to suit microservices requirements.
